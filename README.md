# ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2

The ITfoxtec Identity Saml2 package implements the most important parts of the SAML-P standard and some optional features. 
Message signing and validation as well as decryption is supported. The package supports SAML 2.0 login, logout, single 
logout and metadata. Both SP Initiated and IdP Initiated sign on is supported.  
The package supports redirect binding, post binding and artifact binding.

> ## SAML 2.0 to OpenID Connect 1.0 bridge
> You can sign up for free and use [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com) as a [bridge from SAML 2.0](https://www.foxids.com/docs/bridge) to OpenID Connect.
> FoxIDs handles the [SAML 2.0](https://www.foxids.com/docs/up-party-saml-2.0) traffic to the Identity Provider (IdP) and your application connects to FoxIDs with [OpenID Connect](https://www.foxids.com/docs/down-party-oidc).  
> *SAML 2.0 is an old standard with its shortcomings, and therefore it is often a better choice to use OpenID Connect in an application.*  
> You can likewise use FoxIDs to translate from the Danish [NemLog-in3 (MitID)](https://www.foxids.com/docs/up-party-howto-saml-2.0-nemlogin) and [Context Handler](https://www.foxids.com/docs/howto-saml-2.0-context-handler) to OpenID Connect.

The ITfoxtec Identity Saml2 package is tested for compliance with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), AD FS, Azure AD B2C, the Danish NemLog-in3 (MitID), the Danish Context Handler (in Danish called FÃ¦lleskommunal Adgangsstyring) and many other IdPs and RPs.

Please see the [test samples](test).
